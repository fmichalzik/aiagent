# aiagent
A toy version of Claude Code using Google's free Gemini API!

Building an LLM-powered command-line program capable of reading, updating, and running Python code using the Gemini API. Learn how LLMs and agentic coding tools work.

#### What Does the Agent Do?

1. Accepts a coding task (e.g., "strings aren't splitting in my app, pweeze fix 🥺👉🏽👈🏽")
2. Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task, for example:
      - Scan the files in a directory
      - Read a file's contents
      - Overwrite a file's contents
      - Execute the python interpreter on a file
3. Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails miserably, which is possible)

#### Learning Goals
Learn how LLMs and agentic coding tools work.
Practice Python and functional programming skills.
